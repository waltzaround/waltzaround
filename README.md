# Walter Lim 

O hai! I'm Walter, a designer building open source [volunteering software](https://voluntarily.nz), and a simple [online store builder](https://swiftly.nz) to help small businesses. I'm based in Auckland, New Zealand and I love playing with experimental tech when it's not used in production systems 😅 .  See repos or [personal website](https://walt.online) for more info. 

## My values
🦄  &nbsp;&nbsp;Listen thoroughly<br>
🧐  &nbsp;&nbsp;Keep it simple silly<br>
🤺  &nbsp;&nbsp;Pick your battles<br>
💩  &nbsp;&nbsp;Do awesome good stuff

## How I work / What I believe 
I try to ensure everyone is on the same boat in terms of context and purpose before either designing or building. I see design & UX research not as a guaranteed panacea for success as some might dangerously proselytise, but rather as a set of tools that demand nuance given that the [correlation/causation fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_does_not_imply_causation) is always a risk. (or even subject to [p-hacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_dredging) or [HARKing](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1207/s15327957pspr0203_4) if someone is feeling malicious 🤮 ) 
<br><br>
I regard code and wireframes as cheap if it's a new project, but it becomes exponentially expensive to maintain, or let alone design for given enough time and pivoting.
