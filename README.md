# Walter Lim 

O hai! I'm Walter, a designer from New Zealand who loves designing + building ridiculous things with experimental tech to try stuff out.  See repos or [personal website](https://walt.online) for more info. 

## My values
🦄  &nbsp;&nbsp;Listen thoroughly<br>
🧐  &nbsp;&nbsp;Keep it simple<br>
🤺  &nbsp;&nbsp;Pick your battles<br>
💩  &nbsp;&nbsp;Do awesome shit that helps people

## How I work / What I believe 
I try to ensure everyone is on the same boat in terms of context and purpose before either designing or building any bets we might make. 

I see design & UX research not as a guaranteed panacea for success as some might dangerously proselytise, but rather as a set of tools that demand nuance given that the [correlation/causation fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_does_not_imply_causation) is always a risk. (or even subject to [cherry-picking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherry_picking), [p-hacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_dredging) or [HARKing](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1207/s15327957pspr0203_4) if someone is feeling particularly malicious 🤮 )
