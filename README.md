# Walter Lim 

O hai! I'm Walter, a designer working on [open source volunteering software](https://voluntarily.nz), and [a simple online store builder](https://swiftly.nz) to help small businesses. I'm based in Auckland, New Zealand and I love playing with experimental tech (when it's not used in production systems 😅). See repos or personal website for more info. 🤓

🧐  &nbsp;&nbsp;Keep it simple <br>
