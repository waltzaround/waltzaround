# Walter Lim 

O hai! I'm Walter, a designer working on open source [volunteering software](https://voluntarily.nz), and a simple [online store builder](https://swiftly.nz) to help small businesses. I'm based in Auckland, New Zealand and I love playing with experimental tech when it's not used in production systems 😅 .  See repos or [personal website](https://walt.online) for more info. 

## My values
🦄  &nbsp;&nbsp;Listen thoroughly<br>
🧐  &nbsp;&nbsp;Keep it simple <br>
🤺  &nbsp;&nbsp;Pick your battles<br>
💩  &nbsp;&nbsp;Do awesome good stuff

## How I work / What I believe 
I try to ensure everyone is on the same boat in terms of context and purpose before either designing or building. I see design research not as a guaranteed panacea for success, but as a sufficiently useful tool given that the [correlation/causation fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_does_not_imply_causation) is always a risk (or even [p-hacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_dredging) if you're feeling malicious 🤮 ). I see code and wireframes being cheap if its a new project, but becoming exponentially expensive to maintain given enough time and pivoting.
